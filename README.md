### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan Nshuti and I am a Fullstack Web Developer. I am open to jobs revolving around either Fullstack Web Development or Backend development. I am open to both onsite and remote opportunities.

To me, the most important things in life are health and love.
In my opinion, the finest universities in the world are exploration through travel and the pursuit of knowledge through reading.

I mostly work with Javascript as a backend language(Node) and my main stack is PREN and my Database of choice is Postgres.I also enjoy writing Python(Django)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building more projects so as to be able to showcase my skills.
